[Space Zoom]
The S24 Ultra has a new, high-res, 50 MP tele lens that supports 5x optical zoom*, so you can take outstanding close-up shots and 8K videos from far away. With the significantly improved camera, the S24 Ultra provides quad tele system at 2x, 3x, 5x, and 10x**, and S24+/S24 at 2x and 3x. And enhanced AI multi-frame processing based on deep learning eliminates image quality degradation and creates clear and sharp digital zoom up to 100x in S24 Ultra, and up to 30x in S24+/S24. 
Not only for daytime, the S24 Ultra lets you take brighter, clearer zoom photos, even at night with 1.6x larger sensor size and wider OIS. Of course, night portrait quality with the zoom has surprisingly improved with the AI Night Solution and AI Stereo Depth Map.

[High resolution]
The reinforced AI Engine of the S24 Series recognizes any noise and objects in your frame to enhance details and reduce noise from high-resolution photos. At the same time, the New Adaptive Pixel technology helps to create more natural and accurate color tone. As a result, you can capture high-resolution photos with more lifelike colors and detailed textures. 

[Intelligent Gallery]
Now, AI enhances your editing experience in Gallery. When you straighten your images or move objects in your photos, AI automatically fill the background and blank to complete your photos. Also, just swipe up from your photo and get optical editing suggestions to enhance your photos and videos. It recommends that you use Remaster, Portrait effect, Erase shadows, etc. so you can pick the best one from your results.","
